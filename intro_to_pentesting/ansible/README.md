# Ansible Playbook to Install Tools and Download Wordlists

This Ansible playbook automates the installation of penetration testing tools and the downloading of essential wordlists on a remote VM.

## Prerequisites

1. **Ansible** must be installed on the local machine.
2. **A remote VM** should be accessible with SSH enabled.
3. The remote VM should have Python 3 installed (required by Ansible).
4. **Root or sudo access** is required on the remote VM for installing packages.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and execute the playbook.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (Optional)

Clone this repository to your local machine if you haven't already:

```bash
   git clone 
   cd 
```

### Step 2: Install Ansible

If you don't have Ansible installed, you can install it using `pip`:

```bash
   pip install ansible
```
Alternatively, you can install it using apt on Ubuntu-based systems:


```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible
```

This ensures that the instructions for installing Ansible are clearly formatted.

### Step 3: Create the Inventory File

Create an `inventory` file that contains the details of your target VM. This file should list the IP address of the machine you wish to manage with Ansible. For example:

```ini
[targets]
172.233.47.103 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=your_password
```

Replace 172.233.47.103 with the actual IP address of your target VM and your_password with the correct password for the root user.

Ensure the inventory file is in the same directory as your Ansible playbook or specify its path when running the playbook.

The file should look like this:

```
   [targets]
   172.233.47.103 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_pass=your_password
```


This provides clear instructions on how to create the inventory file needed for Ansible to interact with your target VM.

### Step 4: Create the Playbook File

Now, create the Ansible playbook file that will install the required tools and wordlists on your VM. You can name the playbook file `setup_tools.yaml`. Here's the content for the playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install tools and wordlists on VM
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  vars:
    tools:
      - nmap
      - gobuster
      - hydra
      - openvpn
      - wget
      - curl
      - ssh
      - git
      - python3
      - tcpdump
      - sqlmap
      - ffuf

  tasks:
    - name: Update apt package manager
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        force_apt_get: yes

    - name: Install required tools
      apt:
        name: "{{ tools }}"
        state: latest
        force_apt_get: yes

    - name: Install unzip package
      apt:
        name: unzip
        state: present

    - name: Create wordlists destination directory
      file:
        path: /usr/share/wordlists
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Download SecLists master zip file
      get_url:
        url: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/archive/master.zip
        dest: /tmp/SecList.zip
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Unzip SecLists zip file
      unarchive:
        src: /tmp/SecList.zip
        dest: /usr/share/wordlists/
        remote_src: yes
        creates: /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists-master

    - name: Remove the zip file after extraction
      file:
        path: /tmp/SecList.zip
        state: absent

    - name: Download RockYou wordlist
      get_url:
        url: https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
        dest: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Clean up unnecessary files
      file:
        path: /tmp/SecList.zip
        state: absent
```
This playbook will:

-  Install necessary packages like nmap, hydra, gobuster, etc.
-  Install unzip and create the wordlist directory.
-  Download the SecLists master zip file and the RockYou wordlist.
-  Unzip the SecLists zip file and clean up the zip files after extraction.


Save this playbook file and proceed to the next step.


This provides the full details of how to create the playbook to install the tools and wordlists.


### Step 5: Run the Playbook

Now that the playbook file has been created, you can execute it using Ansible. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure your inventory file is set up correctly (see Step 1).
2. Run the following command to execute the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup_tools.yaml
```
This will run the playbook and install the required tools and download the wordlists on the target VM as specified in your playbook.

Expected Output:
During execution, Ansible will display the progress of each task. You should see something like:
```
PLAY [Install tools and wordlists on VM] ********************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***************************************************************************************************************
ok: [172.233.47.103]

172.233.47.103             : ok=9    changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

## Troubleshooting:
If the playbook fails, use the -vvv flag for verbose output to get more detailed error messages:

   ansible-playbook -i inventory setup_tools.yaml -vvv


### Step 6: Verify the Installation

After running the playbook, it's important to verify that the required tools and wordlists were correctly installed and configured.

#### 1. Check Installed Tools:

You can check whether the tools were successfully installed by running the following command on the target VM:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep -E "nmap|gobuster|hydra|openvpn|wget|curl|ssh|git|python3|tcpdump|sqlmap|ffuf"
```

This will display a list of installed tools. If the tools were installed correctly, you should see output similar to this:

```
ii  nmap                              7.91-1build1                   amd64        Network exploration tool and security scanner
ii  gobuster                          3.0.0-1                        amd64        tool to perform directory and file brute-forcing
ii  hydra                             9.2-1                          amd64        parallelized login cracker
ii  openvpn                           2.4.9-1build1                  amd64        full-featured SSL VPN solution
ii  wget                              1.20.3-1ubuntu1.1              amd64        retrieves files from the web via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP
...
```

2. Check Wordlists:
Verify that the SecLists and RockYou wordlists were successfully downloaded and unarchived:

Navigate to the directory where the wordlists were stored:
```
   cd /usr/share/wordlists/

   ls -l
```
You should see the wordlists, including the SecLists-master and rockyou.txt files. Example
```
   drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4096 Oct  1 14:33 SecLists-master
   -rw-r--r--  1 root root  6968 Oct  1 14:33 rockyou.txt
```

If these files are present, the playbook has successfully installed the wordlists.
